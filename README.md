```gfold``` is a CLI application that helps you keep track of multiple Git repositories.

## Description and Motivation

This app displays relevant information for multiple Git repositories in one directory or folder.
By default, ```gfold``` looks at every Git repository in the current working directory.
However, you can use the ```-p/--path``` flag to target another directory.

While this tool might seem limited in scope and purpose, that is by design.
Features, such as recursive search and async-await support, are future goals.
This application aims to do one or few things well.

One more thing: doing one or few things well includes not only the usual Linux/macOS amd64 users, but users from multiple major platforms and architectures.

## Installation

While there are no release builds at the moment, you can build ```gfold``` by executing the following.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

There's only two usage options at the moment (CWD or specified path), but you can use the ```--help``` flag for more details.

```bash
gfold --help
```

## Compatibility

```gfold``` should work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
All external crates were vetted for multi-platform (including Windows 10) support.

The CI/CD pipeline currently only tests Ubuntu amd64 builds, but this is subject to change.
While not officially tested in a GitHub Action, its worth noting that the application is developed natively on a Windows 10 amd64 machine.

## Future Plans

- Add recursive function to search sub-directories.
- Replace sequential functions with async-await.
- Add installation instructions with releases available.
- Add version checking, using the GitHub API ([example: bat](https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/bat/releases/latest)), to compare the latest tag with Clap's local version.
